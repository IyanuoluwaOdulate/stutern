    <h2>Nigerian Yam Porridge</h2>
    <p>
      Asaro which is also known as Yam pottage or Yam porridge is a very
      delicious Yam recipe though it’s eaten by most tribes in Nigeria however,
      it is more common in the Yoruba-speaking parts of Nigeria. It’s also easy
      to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asaro is made from Puna Yam which is boiled till it’s tender and it’s
      cooked in a blend of peppers, tomatoes, onions, palm oil, and seasoning.
      While the dish is more common in the Yoruba-speaking region of Nigeria, it
      is still a meal enjoyed by the majority alike each with their own regional
      variation.
    </p>
    <p>It's usually not cooked with vegetables but you can add some to give
        your meal some colour.
