        <h1><strong>Frontend Developer.</strong></h1>
        <p class="text">
          Inspired by the need to be among the women excelling in the tech
          industry, I recently started my front-end development journey, with a
          desire to learn back-end development once I'm well versed in
          front-end, as my goal is to become an accomplished full stack
          developer.

        <h3>My Career So Far</h3>
        <p>
          I started self-learning HTML and CSS using Sololearn and freecodecamp
          before getting the opportunity to be selected as one of the
          beneficiaries of the I4G scholarship in collaboration with Stutern.
          I'm currently taking Front end classes at Stutern, and I've had the
          opportunity to work on some projects given to us as assignments,
          including this portfolio website.
